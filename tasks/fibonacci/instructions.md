Please write a Python function that calculates and prints the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.

Requirements:
1. Create a function called `fibonacci(n)` that generates the first n Fibonacci numbers
2. The function should return a list of the numbers
3. Create a script that calls fibonacci(100) and prints all the numbers nicely formatted
4. Test your function to make sure it works correctly
5. Save the script to a file called 'fibonacci.py' in the /results directory

Please work through this step by step, testing your code as you go.
